WinPriv is system administration utility that alters the runtime behavior of
the specified process and its child processes. It does this by loading a
supplemental library into memory to intercept and alter the behavior of
common low-level functions such as registry and file system operations.

WinPriv can be used for a variety of purposes including testing security
settings without altering system-wide policy, implementing security-related
workarounds on a per-process basis instead of altering system-wide policy, and
taking advantageous of system privileges to perform file system auditing and
reconfiguration.

WinPriv comes in normal version (WinPriv) and a console version (WinPrivCmd).
The behavior of the subprocess is the same regardless of which version is used.
These versions are provided in case the target program is a console program
in which case you will only be able to get its screen output if you use
WinPrivCmd. Similarly, you may not wish to see the console windows when
targeting a non-console program in which case it may be advantageous to use
WinPriv.

Optional Switches
=================

/RegOverride <Registry Key Path> <Value Name> <Data Type> <Data Value>

   Specifies a registry value to override. Instead of returning the true
   registry value for the specified key path and value name, the value
   the value specified in this switch is returned.

   Examples:

      /RegOverride HKCU\Software\Demo Enabled REG_DWORD 1
      /RegOverride HKLM\Software\Demo UserName REG_SZ "James Bond"

/RegBlock <Registry Key Path>

   Specified a registry key under which all values will be reported as
   non-existent. When the application requests a particular value in the
   specified key or one of its subkeys, it will be reported as not found
   regardless as to whether it actually exists in the registry.

   Examples:

      /RegBlock HKCU\Software\Demo

/MacOverride <MAC Address>

   Specifies a physical network address that will be returned when the target
   application makes a query to the system to provide its MAC addresses. Any
   call to GetAdaptersAddresses, GetAdaptersInfo, and NetWkstaTransportEnum
   is handled. The hex octets can be delimited by dashes, colons, or nothing.

   Examples:

      /MacOverride 00-11-22-33-44-66

/HostOverride <Target HostName> <Replacement HostName>

   Specifies that any request to obtain the IP address for the specified target
   will instead receive the specified replacement IP address. This is done by
   intercepting calls to WSALookupServiceNext() which nearly all address 
   lookups ultimately occur. Be aware due to special security protections, 
   this will not work for Internet Explorer and programs that use Internet 
   Explorer libraries but should work for most other processes.

   Examples:

      /HostOverride google.com yahoo.com
      /HostOverride google.com 127.0.0.1

/FipsOn & /FipsOff

   This option will turn cause the system to report that Federal Information
   Processing System enforcement is turned on or off, regardless of its current
   setting on the system. This operation is a convenience option that actually
   uses the /RegOverride functionality on the FIPS-related registry key.

/PolicyBlock

   This option will cause all registry queries to HKCU\Software\Policies and
   HKCU\Software\Policies. This option is convenience option that actually uses
   the /RegBlock functionality.

/BypassFileSecurity

   This option causes the target process to enable the backup and restore
   privileges and alters the way the program access files to take advantage of
   this extra privileges. When these privileges are enabled, all access
   control lists on the file system are ignored. This allows an administrator
   to inspect and alter files without changing permissions or taking ownership.

   Effective uses of this option include using command line utilities like
   icacls.exe to inspect/alter permissions. Using this with cmd.exe or
   powershell.exe also provide a mean to interact with secured areas.

   Examples:

   Access detailed permissions under 'C:\System Volume Information':
   WinPrivCmd.exe /BypassFileSecurity icacls.exe
      "C:\System Volume Information" /T

/BreakRemoteLocks

   This option attempts to break remote file locks if a file cannot be accessed
   because it is opened by another program remotely. For example, this can be 
   used to allow programs like robocopy to mirror an area where the destination
   system has an in-use file. This option will have no effect if the file is 
   in-use by a program on the same system where WinPriv is executed.

/AdminImpersonate

   This option causes any local administrator check using IsUserAnAdmin() or
   CheckTokenMembership() to unconditionally succeed regardless if the user is
   actually a member of the local administrator group.

/ServerEdition

   This option causes the most common operating system version information
   functions to indicate the that the system is running a server edition of
   the operating system.

/RecordCrypto <Directory>

   This option records the data being inputted to common Windows encryption 
   functions and the data being outputted from common Windows decryption 
   functions. A separate file will be created for each operation in the 
   specified directory. If 'SHOW' is specified instead of a directory path, 
   information is outputted to the console and message boxes, depending of the 
   type of application.

/SqlConnect <String>

   This option replaces the string used in any ODBC string connection with the
   one specified. Alternatively, 'SHOW' can be specified to display a 
   connection string without changing it.

/MeasureTime

   This option measures the execution time of the target process and displays
   it to the user.

/ListPrivileges

   This option displays of list of available privileges and permissions.

Other Notes & Limitations
=========================
- Multiple switches can be specified in a single command. For example, one
  can use multiple /RegBlock and /RegOverride commands to block and override
  the specified set of registry key and values on a specified target program.
